        <h2>Multi-Siteswap Notation</h2>
        <p>I know just what the world needs, yet another juggling notation.</p>
        
        <p>
            The type of juggling patterns described by this notation are multi-juggler synchronous passing patterns. The problem with trying to use Siteswap to describe these patterns is Siteswap only defines patterns in a single dimension, giving only the magnitude of each throw. Multi-juggler is the same has multi-Siteswap. Thus we need a direction to indicate destination hand has well has a magnitude to define a throw. There are a number of other notations that have addressed this issue however, most of these where developed to solve a computer programming challenge thus suffer from taking some visualization skills to understand, nor are they easy write out by hand (unless you just think that way).
        </p>
        <p>
            Sequence notation comes from the way most jugglers think about the pattern they are currently throwing. It only addresses the description of the rhythm of the pattern, which is independent of the number of jugglers, the number of objects, the physical location of the jugglers. in the pattern. It is simply a list of the jugglers with a row of that juggler's throws. Jugglers are named using capital letters A through Z in alphabetical order. Throws are defined has a line from the hand making the throw to the hand receiving the throw at a given magnitude.

            <h3>Throw Notation</h3>
            <p>
                The throw consist of 2 parts, magnitude, and direction.
            </p>
            <div>
                <h4>Magnitude</h4>
                <p>
                    The magnitude is the same has for Siteswap;
                </p>
                <ul class="nobullet">
                    <li>0 = empty hand</li>
                    <li>1 = hand-across</li>
                    <li>2 = hold</li>
                    <li>3 = normal height pass</li>
                    <li>4 = double height pass</li>
                    <li>and so on</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Because a magnitude of 3 is the common case, it can be assumed when writing a rhythm</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Direction</h4>
                <p>
                    The direction is defined relative to the current hand and is based in a 2 juggler pattern. In a 2 juggler pattern there are 4 possible directions that a throw can go and each is represented by a single letter;
                </p>
                <ul class="nobullet">
                    <li><b>P</b> - throw to other juggler&rsquo;s opposite hand (A straight Pass, right-to-left or left-to-right)<br><img src="resources/Pass.svg"  alt="Straight pass from right to left hand"/></li>
                    <li><b>D</b> - throw to other juggler&rsquo;s same hand (A Diagonal pass, right-to-right, or left-to-left)<br><img src="resources/Diagonal.svg" alt="Diagonal pass from right to right hand"/></li>
                    <li><b>S</b> - throw to other hand (a Self throw)<br><img src="resources/Self.svg" alt="Self pass from right to left hand"/></li>
                    <li><b>H</b> - throw to same hand (a Heff)<br><img src="resources/Heff.svg" alt="Heff in the right hand"/></li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    For more patterns with more than 2 Jugglers in the pattern, append the letter of the destination juggler.
                </p>
            </div>
            <ul class="nobullet"><li>3PB</li></ul>
            <p>
                This throw notation can be farther simplified because a magnitude of 3 will be the normal, the magnitude value can be dropped. Also, the juggler designation can be dropped
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>The number of jugglers </li>
                <li>The initial physical location and orientation of each juggler</li>
                <li>A description of how the jugglers move through the pattern</li>
                <li>The location that each object starts from</li>
                <li>A description of how objects move between hands over time</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                From the point of view of a juggler in the pattern what you want a list of where each object is at, or where it is going, or where is coming from, at some regular occurring point of time and that is independent of physical location of the hands are traveling between. The most widely known notation Siteswap side steps the issue of physical location a There are a number of parts that work together to fully describe a pattern;
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> The <b>topology</b> is the locations of the</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                In order to fully describe a throw requires a vector, an entity that has both a magnitude and a direction. Siteswap the most well known juggling rhythm notation only gives the magnitude of the throw by defining a 1 dimensional .    there
