        <h1>Multi-Siteswap Notation</h1>
        <p>Just what the world needs, yet another juggling notation.</p>
        <p>
            Siteswap notation uses a list of magnitude of throws to represent the rhythm of a juggling pattern. The magnitude indicates a number of units of time before the object reaches its destination. Throws happen at a rate of one per unit of time by the next hand in the pattern, when all hands in the pattern have thrown, start back with the first hand. This works fine for single juggler where there are only 2 hands and it is easy figure out the destination hand. It also works for multiple jugglers, referred to has Multi-handed Siteswap, but because the magnitudes a siteswap are split among the jugglers in the pattern, it requires a fair bit to calculation to determine both the magnitude and direction of each throw. Also the nature of Multi-handed Siteswap patterns are not what are &quot;normal&quot; passing patterns.  
        </p>
        <p>
            The type of juggling patterns described by Multi-Siteswap Notation (MSN) are patterns where there are multiple jugglers each maintaining a siteswap synchronized with all others in the pattern. In order to fully describe this type of pattern requires not only knowing the magnitude of each throw but also direction, which means the location of the destination hand relative to hand making the throw must be known.  Given that Siteswap notation does not contain information about the direction of throw it enough information about the throws let alone a full pattern.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to fully describe a pattern requires 2 components;
        </p> 
            <ol>
                <li><b>Layout</b> - Contains the number of jugglers, where each is located, what their orientation is, and possibly movement information </li>
                <li><b>Rhythm</b> - Contains information about how objects move through hands over time. </li>
            </ol>
        <p>
            Both components are needed to describe a multi-siteswap pattern. However they are independent of the other. The layout provides the physical framework that the rhythm plays out across.     
        </p>
        <h2>Layout</h2>
        <p>
            The layout component defines information about the jugglers, the number, the location of each, and what there orientation is. The way MSN does this is to draw a picture and labeling each juggler in the layout with a capital letter starting with &rsquo;A&rsquo; and proceeding through the alphabet. The figure we will be using on this site is;<br />

        <p>
            Sequence notation comes from the way most jugglers think about the pattern they are currently throwing. It only addresses the description of the rhythm of the pattern, which is independent of the number of jugglers, the number of objects, the physical location of the jugglers. in the pattern. It is simply a list of the jugglers with a row of that juggler's throws. Jugglers are named using capital letters A through Z in alphabetical order. Throws are defined has a line from the hand making the throw to the hand receiving the throw at a given magnitude.

            <h3>Throw Notation</h3>
            <p>
                The throw consist of 2 parts, magnitude, and direction.
            </p>
            <div>
                <h4>Magnitude</h4>
                <p>
                    The magnitude is the same has for Siteswap;
                </p>
                <ul class="nobullet">
                    <li>0 = empty hand</li>
                    <li>1 = hand-across</li>
                    <li>2 = hold</li>
                    <li>3 = normal height pass</li>
                    <li>4 = double height pass</li>
                    <li>and so on</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Because a magnitude of 3 is the common case, it can be assumed when writing a rhythm</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Direction</h4>
                <p>
                    The direction is defined relative to the current hand and is based in a 2 juggler pattern. In a 2 juggler pattern there are 4 possible directions that a throw can go and each is represented by a single letter;
                </p>
                <ul class="nobullet">
                    <li><b>P</b> - throw to other juggler&rsquo;s opposite hand (A straight Pass, right-to-left or left-to-right)<br><img src="resources/Pass.svg"  alt="Straight pass from right to left hand"/></li>
                    <li><b>D</b> - throw to other juggler&rsquo;s same hand (A Diagonal pass, right-to-right, or left-to-left)<br><img src="resources/Diagonal.svg" alt="Diagonal pass from right to right hand"/></li>
                    <li><b>S</b> - throw to other hand (a Self throw)<br><img src="resources/Self.svg" alt="Self pass from right to left hand"/></li>
                    <li><b>H</b> - throw to same hand (a Heff)<br><img src="resources/Heff.svg" alt="Heff in the right hand"/></li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    For more patterns with more than 2 Jugglers in the pattern, append the letter of the destination juggler.
                </p>
            </div>
            <ul class="nobullet"><li>3PB</li></ul>
            <p>
                This throw notation can be farther simplified because a magnitude of 3 will be the normal, the magnitude value can be dropped. Also, the juggler designation can be dropped
            </p>
            <p>
                From the point of view of a juggler in the pattern what you want a list of where each object is at, or where it is going, or where is coming from, at some regular occurring point of time and that is independent of physical location of the hands are traveling between. The most widely known notation Siteswap side steps the issue of physical location a There are a number of parts that work together to fully describe a pattern;
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> The <b>topology</b> is the locations of the</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                In order to fully describe a throw requires a vector, an entity that has both a magnitude and a direction. Siteswap the most well known juggling rhythm notation only gives the magnitude of the throw by defining a 1 dimensional .    there
